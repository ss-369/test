# Type "reader --help" on the command line to read an
# explanation of the different options.
#
# For example, to specify that Reader should use port 80 (for http)
# and use a Java memory heap size of 200 MB, use the following:
#
# READER_ARGS="--port=80 --max-memory=200"

READER_ARGS="--max-memory=150"


# The user which should run the Reader process. Default "root".
# Note that non-root users are by default not allowed to use ports
# below 1024. Also make sure to grant the user write permissions in
# the music directories, otherwise changing album art and tags will fail.
